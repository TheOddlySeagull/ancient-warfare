# Ancient Warfare Encyclopedia

Hello adventurers, commanders, architects, and rulers of the Minecraft realm!

I'm thrilled to introduce the Ancient Warfare Encyclopedia, a website project that I'm actively developing. The primary aim is to consolidate all structures and structure packs from the Ancient Warfare Mod community. In the long run, it aspires to become a comprehensive Wiki, providing up-to-date information on every aspect of the mod's structure generation feature.

## Project Objectives

The primary objective is to establish a fully functional website, designed for effortless navigation even for newcomers. It will boast an advanced search system facilitating the assimilation of structures, acting as a comprehensive platform where every structure author can showcase their work. This setup ensures that users can easily download and access detailed information about each structure.

Furthermore, the website will include comprehensive descriptions for the majority of structures. Additionally, it will serve as a valuable tool for pack authors by allowing them to assess the configuration of their structures. The inclusion of a visual interface will aid authors in identifying and rectifying any potential issues.

In the long run, there is a vision to incorporate a 3D rendering of structures, providing users with a more immersive experience. Expanding the project's scope to encompass all Ancient Warfare features and sharing the lore surrounding the mod are also integral components of the long-term vision.

## Website Features

The website operates on a self-hosted server, which I personally own. This server also hosts multiple Minecraft servers, including an Ancient Warfare build server and a semi-RP survival server dedicated to Ancient Warfare.

Situated in France, the website's hosting location aligns with my French background.

At present, the website successfully compiles and organizes over 4200 structures from various packs associated with the Ancient Warfare mod. While featuring a basic search engine, ongoing improvements are in progress to enhance its functionality. The website is designed to be user-friendly, ensuring easy navigation and comprehension for all users.

## Engaging the Community

Your input and suggestions for new features are highly encouraged and valued. In this expansive project, your contributions serve as a tremendous source of motivation and support.
