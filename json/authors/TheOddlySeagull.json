  "description": "Greetings! I'm Seagull, currently pursuing my master's in IT. Additionally, I'm the one who has built this site for all of you. I've been active in Minecraft since 2014, contributing to numerous projects. However, since 2018, I've dedicated a significant amount of time to building within the Ancient Warfare 2 mod.\nI have built lots of things! Initially, I started with small builds for the Mohawky pack. Over time, my repertoire expanded, cumulating to a whopping 3000 structures spread across the Mohawky pack and my own two packs. While my primary focus lies on the Empire, Sarkonids, Norska, and Noggs, I've also crafted structures for many other tribes and nations, employing a diverse range of styles. Furthermore, I strive to ensure that my builds are as historically and culturally accurate as possible.\nMany of my \"survival structures\", featuring both vanilla and modded wood variants, were generated by scripts I authored, allowing a vast array of colors for any biome.",
