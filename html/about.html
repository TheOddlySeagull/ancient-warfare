            <h2>Welcome to the Ancient Warfare Structures Encyclopedia</h2>
            <p>Hello adventurers, commanders, architects, and rulers of the Minecraft realm! This website is dedicated to consolidating all structures and structure packs from the Ancient Warfare Mod community, aiming to become a comprehensive wiki for the mod's structure generation feature.</p>

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>Our primary objective is to provide an easy-to-navigate website that acts as a comprehensive platform for structure authors to showcase their work, and for users to download and learn about each structure. We are constantly working to improve the site, with plans to include 3D renderings of structures and expand our coverage to all aspects of Ancient Warfare.</p>

            <h3>Contact Us</h3>
            <p>If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute to the project, feel free to reach out. Your feedback is invaluable as we strive to make this encyclopedia a resourceful and engaging experience for all Ancient Warfare enthusiasts.</p>
