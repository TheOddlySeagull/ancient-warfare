# Ancient Warfare Encyclopedia

Welcome to the Ancient Warfare Encyclopedia project! This repository houses the codebase for our self-hosted website dedicated to cataloging structures and structure packs from the Ancient Warfare Minecraft mod community. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive resource for players, builders, and modders alike, facilitating easy access to a vast array of structures.

## Project files

### Jsons

#### descriptions.json

This file contains the descriptions for all the structures. It is used to populate the website with the relevant information. It works as a dictionary, with the structure name as the key and the description as the value. The names are case-sensitive and must match the structure names in the structure packs.

#### structures.json

This file contains the structure data. It is used to populate the website with the relevant information. It works as a dictionary, with the structure name as the key and the structure data as the value. Its architecture mirrors the way the .aws structure files are organized.
This json is generated by script, and is not meant to be edited manually.

#### structures_version.json

This file contains the version of the website's structure database. It is used to check if the user's local database is up to date with the website's database. The file is updated every time the website's database is updated.

### python scripts

#### structure_data_converter.py

This script is used to convert the .aws structure files into the structures.json file. It is meant to be run every time a new structure pack is added to the website, or when a structure is updated or removed from the website. The script will generate the structures.json file, which is used to populate the website with the relevant information.
